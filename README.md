In this example, we demonstrate how to build a simple chatbot using LangChain with both a paid LLM (OpenAI) and an open-source LLM (Llama 2 via Ollama). We walk through setting up prompts, integrating with Streamlit for a user interface, and tracking all LLM calls in real time using LangSmithâ€™s observability dashboard. This approach allows you to seamlessly switch between different models while keeping the rest of your code and logic consistent.
